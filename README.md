# Kubernetes Journey
My journey to learning Kubernetes. The end goal is to deploy and maintain Kubernetes clusters at home - I plan on using old machines at home; to repurpose these machines to servers and maintain them. To best use Kubernetes, I need to solidify my foundations on specific topics or concepts. These are listed below (they are not listed in any order).

## Topics
- Linux 
- Docker
- Networking 
  - [Networking Essentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHkbPm1Wrno)
- Kubernetes
